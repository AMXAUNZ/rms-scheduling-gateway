# RMS Scheduling Gateway

Experimental data connector for RMS scheduling and the AMX Inspired XPert/XPress digital signage platform. This is a proof of concept project that extracts current and near-future scheduling information from a subset of locations and exports to an XML file for ingest by a signage solution. The XML file may then be accessed via the master's build in web or ftp server. E.g. `http://<master ip>/<filename>.xml`.
